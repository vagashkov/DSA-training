## Array operations time (T) and space (S) complexity:

- Access: T = O(1), S = O(1);
- Set: T = O(1), S = O(1);
- Traverse/search: T = O(N), S = O(1);
- Copy:  T = O(N), S = O(N);
- Insert element:
   * at the beginning: T = O(N), S = O(1);
   * at the end: T = O(1), S = O(1);
   * in between: T = O(N), S = O(1);
- Remove element:
   * at the beginning: T = O(N), S = O(1);
   * at the end: T = O(1), S = O(1);
   * in between: T = O(N), S = O(1);
